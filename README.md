This is Tony's Labs of Computer Organization on Risc-V (@Zhejiang University)

This is only for exchanging ideas & sparking innovation. I'm not responsible for **plagiarize**.

Note: For Lab5, I meet lots of bugs when dealing with pipeline and verilog writing, so that the whole directory was actually in mess. I'll repair it as long as I get a leisure time. Also, the forwarding unit of the pipeline is not implemented(as a bonus).

For Lab6(actually as a bonus), the cache meets the basic requirement of the test, but details were not perfect yet.

Any advice is appreciated!
